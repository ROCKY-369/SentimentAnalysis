# Sentimental Analysis  
Sentiment Analysis also known as opinion mining is a major task in natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on converting normal text into emotions. With the gradual growth in social platforms, understanding sentiment has become increasingly important for various applications such as market research, social media monitoring, and customer feedback analysis. The large amount of user review data is quite useful for the ecommerce websites to know the opinion, attitude, and sentiment towards products, services, and events. Analysing and extracting sentiment from this textual data will be helpful for all the websites, platforms, and products to get an idea of public opinion and to improve their business for better user support.

Technologies Used: 
• VScode   
• PyCharm  
• NLP Emotion Algorithm  
• NLP K library is basically a very famous library for national language processing. 
• PostgreSQL /My SQL (Data storage and data retrieval)  
• Matplotlib (Python Libraries), object-oriented programming

Sentiment analysis is a computer technique for locating and classifying viewpoints in written material, particularly to ascertain the writer's stance on a certain subject, item, etc. whether it be favourable, unfavourable, or neutral. Sentiment analysis with Python's 
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) presents the following challenges: 
• Data Collection: Compile a collection of opinion-expressing words or tweets. 
• Text Preprocessing: To clean and prepare the data, make use of NLTK's text processing features. This covers stop-word elimination, stemming, and tokenization. 
• Feature extraction: Look for the presence of important words or phrases that are frequently suggestive of sentiment by using NLTK. 
• Vectorization: Utilized the TF-IDF technique to convert text into a format suitable for the LSTM model, ensuring that the input data retained essential textual features for sentiment analysis. 
• Sentiment Classification: Use the built-in sentiment analysis features of NLTK, such VADER or custom classifiers, to classify each text or tweet according to its sentiment.  
• Model Evaluation: By contrasting the model's predictions with a manually labelled test set, you may determine how accurate the sentiment analysis using NLTK was.
